Pyhton
Python provides lots of features that are listed below.

1) Easy to Learn and Use
Python is easy to learn and use. It is developer-friendly and high level programming 
language.
 

2) Expressive Language
Python language is more expressive means that it is more understandable and readable.


3) Interpreted Language
Python is an interpreted language i.e. interpreter executes the code line by line at a time.
This makes debugging easy and thus suitable for beginners.


4) Cross-platform Language
Python can run equally on different platforms such as Windows, Linux, Unix and Macintosh 
etc. So, we can say that Python is a portable language.


5) Free and Open Source
Python language is freely available at python.org .The source-code is also available. 
Therefore it is open source.


6) Object-Oriented Language
Python supports object oriented language and concepts of classes and objects come
 into existence.


7) Extensible
It implies that other languages such as C/C++ can be used to compile the code and
thus it can be used further in our python code.


8) Large Standard Library
Python has a large and broad library and prvides rich set of module and functions
for rapid application development.


9) GUI Programming Support
Graphical user interfaces can be developed using Python.

Basic Program of Hello World


>>>print('Hello World ')
Hello World

   Or


>>>print("Hello World")
Hello World


# NO effect of single or duoble quotes

>>> print('*' * 5)

VARIABLE'S ---
                Variable's are use to store temporary Data in the Computer Memory

                
p = 1                              (p is a integer type Variable)


x = 3.2                           (x is floating point variable)   
y = 3.0                           (y is floating point varible)


z = 'string'                      (z is a string type)


b = True / False              (b is boolean Type)

In the above example,

• p is an integer (a whole number without a decimal point)

• x and y are float (a number with a decimal point)

• z is a string (a sequence of characters)

• b is a boolean. Boolean values can be True or False.

 input() --
           Returns a string and use to take a input from the user

           tr  =  input('Promt')

           tr is string type variable
           
If we want to convert the tr variable into integer or floating type variable 

tr = int(tr)                                           for interger

tr  = float(tr)                                       for floating point 

Comments
We use comments to add notes to our code. Good comments explain the hows and

whys, not what the code does. That should be reflected in the code itself. Use

comments to add reminders to yourself or other developers, or also explain your

assumptions and the reasons you’ve written code in a certain way.

# This is a comment and it won’t get executed.

# Our comments can be multiple lines.
