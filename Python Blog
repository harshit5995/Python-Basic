VARIABLE'S ---
                Variable's are use to store temporary Data in the Computer Memory
                
P = 1           (P is a integer type Variable)

p = 3.2         (p is floating point variable)   
p= 3.0          (p is floating point varible)

p = 'string'     (p is a string type)

p = True / False (p is boolean Type)

input() --
           Returns a string and use to take a input from the user
           tr  =  input('Promt')
           tr is string type variable
           
If we want to convert the tr variable into integer or floating type variable 
tr = int(tr)    for interger
tr  = float(tr) for floating point
